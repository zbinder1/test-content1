Up to eight off-cycle payrolls can be created with the same pay date for each pay group. All payrolls for the pay group must be closed before you can reset the year.</p><p>In an off-cycle payroll, the Record of Employment (ROE) information for the employee is not populated. The ROE Pay Date needs to be entered on the line with earnings considered insurable for hours and/or wages. In the Earnings area of the cheque, the ROE column should be added so that a date can be entered.</p><p>Year-end adjustments may be needed for the following:</p><ul id="ul_wyv_5bp_q1b"><li>Pension Adjustments</li><li>Taxable Benefits</li><li>Group Term Life Insurance</li><li>Taxable or Non-Taxable Moving Expenses</li></ul><p>For companies using the UltiPro Tax Filing Service (available in the United States and Canada), UltiPro displays a warning if the pay date selected does not provide enough time to have the tax file delivered before the deadline to avoid penalties or fines.</p><image href="TaxComplAddOffCyclePORT_18786.jpg"><alt>Add an Off-Cycle Payroll</alt></image></conbody></concept>
