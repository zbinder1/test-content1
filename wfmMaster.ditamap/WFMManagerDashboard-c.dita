An Activity section lists To Do items (for example, timesheet approval) and Notification items (for example, a scheduled report is ready). A single To Do item can be selected and action can be taken. For more than one of the same To Do item, the items are grouped together (for example, "5 Timesheets are pending approval"). Managers can select the To Do item and go to the area where they can take action. Managers can select a notification and go to the appropriate area that triggered the notification. They can clear a single notification or all notifications.</p><p>The Upcoming Team Time Off section lists approved time off per month for all employees that report to you. To cancel an employee's approved time off, select the date link next to the employee's name in the list and then select Cancel Request on the Time Off Details page. The View Team Time Off link opens the Team Time Off calendar in Time Off and Allowances.</p><p>In the Timesheet Status section, drop-down lists are available for the Timesheet Configuration Group and Pay Group. This section shows the number of submitted, not submitted, and approved timesheets; select the number in the status and you are directed to where you can take action. Any changes made to the timesheets are reflected on the dashboard. Select the number under Errors or Exceptions to open the Errors and Exceptions page; any corrections made on that page are reflected on the dashboard.</p><p>The Insights section shows key analytics including:</p><ul><li>Time Code Summary (for example, work, vacation, or sick)</li><li>Pay Type Summary (for example, regular or overtime)</li><li>Labor Metrics Summary (for example, individual projects)</li></ul><p>When you choose a pay group and a date, the timesheet summary information is based on the selected team and insights. You can drill into the time summary from the dashboard.</p><image href="WFMMgrDashboardInsightsSection.png"><alt>Insights Section of Manager Dashboard</alt></image></conbody></concept>
