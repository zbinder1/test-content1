After you select <uicontrol>Approve</uicontrol>, the timesheet status changes to Approved. The employee is automatically notified that the timesheet was approved or rejected.</cmd><info>If a timesheet is in an Approved or Submitted status and the employee has a pending time off request, a message appears indicating that the request cannot be completed. If the timesheet was manually approved and you have permission to unapprove it, then you can unapprove it, insert the approved time off, and manually reapprove the timesheet. If the timesheet was automatically approved, it is automatically unapproved and you can manually reapprove it. (The MANAGER_TOA_REQUEST_TIMESHEET_WARNING permission must be assigned to your role in the Time Off and Allowances feature.)</info><info>If the ADMIN_TIMESHEET_UNAPPROVE permission has been assigned to you (Settings > Roles > Edit Roles), you can unapprove timesheets, make corrections, and approve the timesheet again. Employees are notified when their timesheets are unapproved, corrected, and approved again.</info><info>If you have retro edit permissions, you can edit a timesheet if the date is within the retro adjustment period. You can make retroactive time adjustments to an employee’s timesheet only during a specific period of time. Only those days that are available for retro edit, having a status of Exported, can be edited. When a retro calculation is exported for the current pay period, the timesheet remains in Approved status and the letter “R” appears on the day the edit was made. Retro calculations can be viewed after the retroactive edits are made on the timesheet.</info><info>If using a web clock, employees and managers can select the Call Back In and Call Back Out buttons to accurately record time and make adjustments. Time clock managers can view calculated values on timesheets to verify that inputs and outputs are correct. The calculated values display as the main information in place of the punches, but an Edit icon displays the punches.</info></step></steps></taskbody></task>
