         <p>The View Password link in the Default Password column is a securable object. System administrators viewing the User Administration page or the User Summary page must have the View permission assigned to the Default Password object to be able to select the View Password link and see the default password value for any employee or guest user (Role Administration &gt; select a role &gt; Web Access Rights &gt; Security &gt; User Administration &gt; View Default Password). Without permissions to the Default Password object, the View Password link does not display.</p>
