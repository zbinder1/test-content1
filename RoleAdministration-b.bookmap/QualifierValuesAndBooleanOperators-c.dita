In addition, any employee being added to either company will be automatically visible to the user. For an employee to be auto-assigned to the group, he/she needs to meet only one of the qualifiers.</p><p>However, if multiple values of different qualifiers are used, the Boolean operator, AND, is implied between the qualifiers. For example, if you assign the user to view employees with Company = UEL Corporate Tech and Department = SYSM â€“ Systems Management, the user will only be able to view employees who are in the UEL Corporate Tech company and in the SYSM Systems Management department.</p></conbody></concept>
